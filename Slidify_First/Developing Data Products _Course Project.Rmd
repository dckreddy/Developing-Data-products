### My Shiny App project: Uniform Distribution App

1.The app is built using shiny and hosted on shinyapps.io.
2.Basicly the app calculates probability of a score according to standard normal density.

### Math Formulae
1. Uniform distribution random variable is the form $U(a,b)$
2. Probability Distribution Function  is $f(x)=\frac{1}{b-a}$ for a <= x <= b;
                                                            0 for x < a or x > b

### R code

The probability is calculated using R function punif()

```{r, echo=TRUE}
x = 0.5
lower = T
pnorm(x, mean = 0, sd = 1, lower.tail = lower)
```

The value for x and wether user wants a lower probability or a upper probability are based on user input.
